i didnt got to the docker part
 most of the time i was learning about converting pandas to dict using pydantic

 but i did wrote the yamls, so in theory the commands to run will be:

 ```
dokcer login
docker build jacobsun211/threat-api:v1
docker push jacobsun211/threat-api:v1

oc login --token=sha256~YvIJ9mp3Gwqj17fbilr91z0At9-E7V2etTRTB_laMSQ --server=https://api.rm1.0a51.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443
oc apply -f k8s/
oc get svc     # to get the name of api-service
oc expose service/<threat-api-svc> 

 ```
